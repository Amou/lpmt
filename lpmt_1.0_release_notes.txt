LPMT version 1.0

Release Note
----------------

we have finally decided to release a 1.0 version to mark a milestone, not all issues are addressed and not all bugs have been squeezed,
but anyway, here we go:

new core features
- content horizontal/vertical mirroring in projection surfaces for video, images and live-cam.
- code has been refactored introducing use of FBOs for quads.
- there are now some blending modes possible for projection surfaces.
- an edge-blending feature has been introduced using GLSL shaders, allowing use of several overlapping projectors
 (the edge-blending feature requires a rather good GPU, but should work reliably on most modern systems).

usability enhancements
- now you can activate a projection surface by double-clicking its label, quite useful in setup workflow.
- surfaces labels are no more influenced by quad warping, remaining readable even with strong quad warping.
- mouse-over effect for draggable corners on active surface.

distribution
- new binary version for Windows systems, tested on Windows 7 and Xp.
now Widows binaries are distributed as free trial version, with limited number of projection surfaces and watermarked,
and full version, for which we charge a little fee to compensate for the hassle of firing up a windows machine to compile it.
Obviously LPMT remains an open-source project, and you're free to get the source and compile it yourself.


Known bugs
---------------

- on Windows, if you load images or movies placed outside the LPMT folder structure, you may mess up the default path,
triggering error in finding things like LPMT default font and so on, so you're encouraged to put your projectable assets in
LPMT folder. We are trying to address this issue, but haven't found a solution yet.
Things work well on Linux.

- on Windows, Apple Quicktime is used by Openframeworks for video reproduction, this limits the kind of video assets you
can put in projection surfaces in LPMT. If you try to load a video format not recognized by Quicktime, projection surface
will stay black and no message or explanation will be displayed, or, in worst cases, LPMT may crash silently.
In case of doubt, always use video material that you have tested with Quicktime player to get sure it is playable in LPMT.

- If you plan to manage simultaneously many High Definition video clips, then you are invited to consider to encode them using
a non-cpu intensive codec, or reproduction may be sluggish and choppy. Always consider to re-size your video content according to
projector's resolution: it makes non sense putting a full HD video in a projection surface if your projector is a SVGA one!
